# ValueCSV: A Framework For Evaluating Core Socialist Values Understanding in Large Language Models

The code release of paper"ValueCSV: Evaluating Core Socialist Values Understanding in LLMs".

## Overview
To address the potential social risks and safety challenges associated with Large Language Models (LLMs), human values alignment has been proposed to guarantee LLMs' outputs align with human values
as a key step to achieve responsible AI technology. However, current efforts to align LLMs with human values often rely on value theories such as Schwartzâ€™s value theory or moral foundation theory, which may not capture the full spectrum of diverse cultural or social values. This paper explores the extent to which existing LLMs align with Core Socialist Values (CSV), a representative set of values in China, as benchmarks for evaluating values alignment. Our framework is publicly available at [here](https://github.com/ValueCSV).

In this repository, we provide:

- ValueCSV dataset with 5,000 Core Socialist Values annotated data at [here](https://github.com/ValueCSV/ValueCSV/blob/main/Dataset/ValueCSV5000.xlsx).

- Code for training CSV evaluator. Flie [Multi_evaluator.py](https://github.com/ValueCSV/ValueCSV/blob/main/Code/Multi_evaluator.py) for training Multi-label classifier and file [Binary_evaluator.py](https://github.com/ValueCSV/ValueCSV/blob/main/Code/Binary_evaluator.py) for training seperate binary classifiers.

- A question dataset with 100 question covering diversity CSV dimensions for testing LLM's CSV understanding ability at [here](https://github.com/ValueCSV/ValueCSV/blob/main/Dataset/quest100.xlsx).

## Pretrained Model
We use both [bert-baes-chinese](https://huggingface.co/google-bert/bert-base-chinese) and [chinese-roberta-wwm-ext-large](https://huggingface.co/hfl/chinese-roberta-wwm-ext-large) as backstones of evaluators.
